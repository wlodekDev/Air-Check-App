## Air and weather App - Aaw App
The user's geolocation data is necessary to use the application.
****
An app is using 3 different APIâ€™s. At first, an app is defining user geolocation data (latitude and longitude). Afterward, an app is using one of the API to find one station which is measuring air quality, which is nearest us, to get particular ID number. Next step is to transfer this ID to another API to fetch data about air quality in our location. The last API is fetching data about the weather in our location.
